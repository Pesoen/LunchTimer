# LunchTimer
a simple lunch timer, in case you dont want to be bothered with remembering it.

should work anywhere, is made with .net 4.0 for best compatibility.

simply set the timer to the lunch times you want, it will play a classic windows sound when the times match, and it will continue playing until the minute value changes.

it will also display a small text next to the current time in the bottom, to help show, which timer has gone off.

the program will stay on top. and you can minimize it, i am working on a tray icon, instead of taskbar icon.

it has some settings, use right click to see what it can do.

unable to create an installer for it, error with my program, but the exe should work fine.
